January 6th  Marouf STUDENT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

*Explicit wait: wait for certain condition/event it allows
    driver to wait for many conditions such as element be clickable appear
    disapear.

a. it does not work globally after it is set. it has to be called 
    specifically for certain evernt. it works once.
b. expected condition class is used for different condition 

*Which locator is the best?
    there is no best locator it all depends on the application the element 
    and the other factors. but this is the order how i try to find elements:

    how i choose locators?
        if its a link i use start with linktext, partiallinktext
    if it is not a link Id
        id , name, class, tag, Name, css, xpath 

    xpath : good for texts index tables child to parent
    xpath not good: can be very fragile means that it can be broken easily if
    the html tree changes hard to read and write.

*Exceptions with implicit wait: 
    - NoSuchElementExceptions will be thrown 
*Exceptions explicit wait:
    - TimeOut Exceptions

* how do you do reporting in selenium:
    - depends on what kind of framework you have.
    - In my current framework because we use cucumber with testNG 
    we use BDD framework currently i am using cucumber html reports. 
    
* how would you verify the position of the webElement on the page:
    - WebElement element = ....
        element.getlocation();

    - Web Element class has a getLocation method and it will return 
    a class call point (X and Y) 2 numbers which is the location the the element

*Can you think about all the different tasks you have had as QA what is
the biggest challange you have had:
    1. when I joined the project the framework in place was poorly 
    written did not follow coding standards. and it was hard to understand.
    I had to convience my team to rewrite the framework from scratch 

*How typically does your day go ? what do you do:
    On daily basis we start working on test cases. Attend meetings scrum meetings
    Talk to team mates. 
    (for example meet with BA/PO to clarify new requirements)

*How much time you spend on manual and automation testing?
    - As and automation engineer I still have to do manual testing. I always
    try to test cases manually before i automate to 1. make sure test case works
    to understand the test case. 
    - When I find a bug I try to recreate the bug manually to get more information about 
    the bug.

*How do you do regression testing:
    In my project we do smoke and regression testing. We schedule and run the tests on 
    Jenkins which is hosted in our AWS server(EC2)
    Using cucumber we have built regression suite. We Have our test cases.
    we run our smoke test every day. and we have our major regresion before our release

*What are the design pattern in selenium?
    Page Object Model is a design pattern used in selenium to mirror the application in 
    certain objects. Using page object model we create a class for each page for our 
    application. in those classes we map the objects and functionality form respective
    pages.

*When Do you run regression Test?
    for releases
    major bugs/code changes/new feature

    code Changes: 



*
















+++++++ GIT  +++++++

VCM (Version Control Manager Tools):
    We have GIT, CVS, SVN we currently are using GIT 

We Store in BitBucket or Github or Gitlab as our repository.

*How do you do code review?
    - what I do everyone on the team joins the webinar and Developer presents your 
    code in your IDE(ECLIPSE, INTELLIJ IDE)

    - Once its approved by everyone, and we are in the same page code is completed 
    and push to remote reporsitory and everyone can now pull and use it. 

*How do you text API services?
    -To test api service i send request to API endpoints and verify response from 
    rest API

    -After learning about restful API endpoints URL's I send Post, Get, Put, DELETE
     type of http requests to those URLS and verify assert the response according 
     to user story / requirement

    - in some scenarios: i make s ure API response data matches the values in database

*I worked in projects where i had to test different application layers:
    1: front end layer/UI automtion -> selenium WebDriver
    2: API layer/restful API -> Postman, RestAssured
    3: Database layer/relational database -> Oracle 11G(version)
            SQL -> JDBC 


*How to validate your response from your API?

    RESPONSE: Status code/status line
            JSON/XML Body
            Content Type
