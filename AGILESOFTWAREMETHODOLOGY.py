_____ AGILE SOFTWARE METHODOLOGY _____



-------------- WATERFALL METHODOLOGY ----------

WATERFALL: requirement gathering, design, coding, testing, production

- requirement gathering: 	-It should upload the video same day
							-video should have audio
							-Students be notifies when complete

"waterfall gives u control and predictibility, therefore waterfall is good
'compare to agile when u do a project in agile and when its done its available

- Design: 

AGILE:	- Based on the requirements SOFTWARE architects will choose
		the tools for the application.
		- Architect will do the design of the application...
		- Decide how the application will be built

CODING: - Based on the requirements developers will write the application
		using tools and techniques chosen during the design phase

TESTING: - Testers will test

DEPLOYMENT: - DEPLOYMENT is the release

MAINTENANCE: - people will fix deffects


whats bad and disadvantage of waterfall?
	
	There is no communication. because each phase is over and they 
	cant go back and fix it.

-------------- AGILE METHODOLOGY ----------
++ there is no time as far as this needs to be done in 5 months ++

BACKLOG: is a LIST that Contains the requirements from the user. list of what to do
		on this project.includes technicle and non technicle story
		- user should be able to see video
		- user should be able to log in the web site
		- create user accounts for the new employee --> its a TASK
		- hours worked goes in the backlog
SPRINT: Sprint is a time duration "it can take 3 months,4"
		Everything you do in agile is done in sprint

SPRINT PLANNING: We go to the backlog and see the stories and we look
		at how much work we can do next 2 weeks. 
		then we pick the stories form the backlog for next two weeks


SPRING BACKLOG: List of Stories that we selected for this sprint 

DAILY SCRUM: once the sprint starts we have a daily stand up meeting
			everyday we inform the team about: what we did last day
			What we plan to do today, and do you have any blockers.

DEMO: Show customer what we buildt for this Sprint

SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE: team will analyze the last sprint discuss problems
					and their cases. 

Shippable Product: end production


AGILE --> is. a METHODOLOGY based on developing software in short iterations
SCRUM, KANBAN --> are implementations of agile

-------------- What is ACRUM AGILE -----------
SCRUM: team plans for the amount of work for the next sprint

-------------- What is KANBAN AGILE ----------

KANBAN: no sprint PLANNING Stories are picked up as is.
		example: if something comes up everyone jumps on it to work
