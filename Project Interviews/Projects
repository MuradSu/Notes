CHALLENGES: 



BCBS ( BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ) - MARCH 2014 - SEPTEMBER 2016
===========================================



FRAMEWORK: 
    I used management and test tools as Eclipse IDE Selenium WebDriver
    Maven Cucumber and Jenkins
    I also used POM Structure in order to keep my code organized and clean
    So basically i created a separate Java class for each page of my application.
    where 




Current FRAMEWORK
     my current framework is based on Data Driven, and Behavior Driven framework, Hybrid Framework 
    i use maven build tool and not only for dependency management 
    but also as a command prompt tool using the pom xml file , i also have specific file that run my smoketest
    regression and functionality tests. 

    for my front end i use selenium WebDriver
    also am using java as programming language working front end and database testing 
    and i use selenium for UI browser automation and in my framework am using POM as my design pattern
  
    for backend testing i am using ResAssured in your framework in order for the process of deserialization 
    to occur that way you store json response into a java collection data structure and assert the data 
    with the expected value. I also have an API utility class which is re-usable
    I also produce high level pojos and map objects

    For Database testing 
    manually I use SQL developer for producing SQL queries and for Automation 
    I use JDB library to integrate Java by using getting a connection from oracle database
    then creating statements using SQL queries and then storing the data into a resultSet
    I use Java data Structures to store data inside and compare them 

    and since I am using Data Driven and cucumber Bdd Framework all of this test are stored inside
    feature files. I have a runner classes that helps me generate codes from feature files 
    and implement them into a file called step definition also have hook class that implement
    my codes that run before and after all my tests and its based on gherkin language. this is where i 
    invoke my takeScreenshot interface
    which triggers when i use Senario interface that takes a screenshot of the step failed 

    For data driven testing if I am working with amounts of test data I am going to operate
    with scenario outlines. this is where i create examples and store datas using pipeline
    if there is large amounts of test data its usually in a external (excel file) so i use 
    APACHE POI to INVOKE DDT excel Automation.

    I also have a logging tool called log4j to log my codes that are basically high risk.
    and lastly for my reports in my framework I use Rerun.txt code in cucumber. generated actually
    by cucumber sandwich library this will store my failed cucumber feature files. 
    then I also have a failed scenario runner class which has the location of my failed scenarios.
    I create a failed scenario xml file. 
    so whenever i have failed feature files I use maven command. mvn -Drunner=failedScenarios xml file to run my
    failed tests.

    Reporting I use html report that has located in target folder which is called cucumber-reports
    and lastly for continous integration devops takes care of configuaration but the tool is invoked
    by a maven command that is provided by the tester. 



Framework

    what is a testing framework?
    
             a testing framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.

    What is the benefit of testing framework?

             improve test efficiency
             lower maitenance

    Types of automated testing framework?

            Data Driven framework
            Bdd framework current project
            keyword is used by UFT 



Pages: we have our webelements and methods

Runners: we have our cukesRunner which run the projects and you can have more runner class for examples
        smokeRunner, RegressionRunner

Step_definition: we have our actual codes and hooks





Feature files: and those files contain executable specifications written in a language called Gherkin.

jenkins is an open source automation server
jenkins helps to automate the non human part of the software development process. 

What is testing framework?
    set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases
what is apache POI.xml?
    access microsoft format files
How to get step_definition methods from feature files?
    right click on the feature file and run as cucumber feature.
GIT what is it?
    version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinate work on those files
WHat is jenkins?
    is a software that allows continues integration
how to send email reports to other people in jenkins?
    configure-> post buildactions-> add post build actions -> editable email notification -> advance -> recipient List
