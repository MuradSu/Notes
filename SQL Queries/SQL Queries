------------ Inner/left/right/outter JOIN -----------

-- Inner join Ans: An SQL Join is used 
-- to combine data from two or more tables, 
-- based on a common field between them. For 
-- example, consider the following two tables.

        select e.first_name, d.manager_id, d.location_id
        from employees e  join departments d
        on e.department_id = d.department_id;

        select e.first_name, d.manager_id, d.location_id
        from employees e left join departments d
        on e.department_id = d.department_id;

        select e.first_name, d.manager_id, d.location_id
        from employees e right join departments d
        on e.department_id = d.department_id;

        select e.first_name, d.manager_id, d.location_id
        from employees e full join departments d
        on e.department_id = d.department_id;

------------ NATURAL JOIN -----------
-- Natural join 
    -- joins on columns with same name
    -- if name changes query will stop working
    -- if new columns are added query may stop working
    -- or show incorrect data
    -- can not qualifier next to e.

            select first_name,
            last_name,
            department_id,
            department_name
            from employees natural join departments;

------------ CARTESIAN JOIN -----------
    -- Not usually what you want
    -- often because join condition is missed
    -- gives you more records than expected
    -- use cross join keyword 

        select first_name
        department_name
        from employees cross join departments;

        select first_name
        department_name
        from employees, departments;

------------ SELF JOIN -----------
    -- join a table to itself
    -- used when a record in a talb eis related to another 
    record in the same table
    -- employee_id // manager_id

            Select e.employee_id,
            e.first_name,
            e.last_name,
            m.first_name,
            m.last_name,
            m.employee_id
            from employees e 
            left join employees m 
            on e.manager_id = m.employee_id;



------------ MULTIPLE TABLES JOIN -----------
