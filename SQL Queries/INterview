1. Can u draw me application structure. It’s layers. What it consists of (UI, database, api...)
2. What were the challenges u have faced and how u solved them?
3. What was the biggest bug u found?
4. Write 2 methods: a) reverse string b) find first repeating letter in the string

5. Now how would u unit test this methods?

 After that,1.5 hours with Indian lady and another Indian guy...surprisingly Indians were more nice than Vadim

1. U have an Json file with different data, how u would validate it?
2. Now same test, but no selenium, no api, only Java
3. Imagine u have json file with 1000 customers that has 5 elements each! 
How would u find exact one customer without looping over json 
    ( I said the only way would do is just to loop over each object of that file, 
    but he said that there is another way also,  its another library that allows u 
    to read exact line from that file, I asked him to tell me what exactly they are called so 
    I could do research, that it sound really cool and would make my life lot more comfortable, 
    he said to make sure that i do researc --> Jsonmanipulation libraries and 
    Json object library)

        example: 

        json_flat = '{"page":"1","total":"2","ids":[{"id":"3085"},{"id":"3086"}]}'; // regular Json     
        json_object = JSON.parse(json_flat); //convert to an object

        //Manipulation
        json_object.page = "6"; //change values
        delete json_object.total; //delete a value

        json_flat = JSON.stringify(json_object); //convert back to flat


4. How would u test api manually. Describe steps
    First of all I start by going over Scenario: Post a note on Dashboard
    When I post "Hello Everyone"
    Then Post should be displayed
    And I logout from application the API documentation. thats where 
    i collect the api Authentication url. in order to get my access token.
    I use postman as manual automation tool I make sure to have access by 
    entering authorization as key and my access token as value. of course
    i have to make sure that content type is json and my acceptance type is also
    Json. Then once i get my call I test based on my API documentation my end points
    currenly i am testing preferences API. I also make sure the status code is 200 
    and that is how i do manual testing. The other option is using the Network option 
    when i inspect my UI application. i check the Headers, Preview, Response. 
    
5. What is maven used for?
6. What is TestNG 
7. How run test locally?

8. What means static and non static methods?

9. Whats overriding and overloading?

10. Why Java? Whats in Java in it that makes you think that Java is what u want to learn?

*How do you test API service?
    I am using Restassured library, what I am verifying is the status code, Response message/error 
    message few other response details like Json format. 

COMMON ERRORS IN API:

    1xx: Informational - Communicates transfer protocol-level information

    2xx: Success -Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.

    3xx: Redirection - Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to 
    complete their request.
    4xx: Client Error - This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.

    5xx: Server Error - The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.

What type is your database?

*Are you storing your JSON body in Oracles?
    Yes I store Json data en Oracle Database using columns whose data types are 
    varchar2. (also clob or blob) the choice of which to use is typically motivated 
    by size of the JSON document i need to manage:
        -I use varchar2 (4000) if my Jason document does not exceed 4000 bytes(or characters)
        -Use VARCHAR2(32767) if you know that some of your JSON documents are larger than 4000 
        bytes (or characters) and you are sure than none of the documents exceeds 32767 bytes 
        (or characters)Footref 1.
        -I use BLOB (BINARY LARGE OBJECT) or CLOB(CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT) storage if you know
        that you have some JSON document that are larger than 32767 bytes or characters

When are you testing your service and your received 500 error and how would you debug it?
    First of all 500 its a internal server error. This isn’t because these errors are usually 
    hard to fix, however. It’s because the error is usually not specific and can occur for a 
    number of different reasons. What i do to debug the error depends upon the server and 
    what’s actually running at the time.
        *DEBUG COMMON PLATFORMS
            1: If the software was just upgraded to a new version, it’s likely that the upgrade 
            failed and needs to be refreshed.

            2: If a new plugin or theme was just activated, it’s probably a good idea to roll that 
            change back and try again. Even well-tested plugins might conflict with other plugins 
            in the installation.

            3: If the software has been upgraded, older plugins or themes might not be compatible 
            with the upgrade. The only course of action is to start deactivating things until the 
            error goes away. That doesn’t directly solve the problem; however, it will find the 
            issue. It might be possible to get the plugin developer to release an update.
        *DEBBUGING SERVER SIDE SCRIPTS
            1: Server permission: Very commonly, incorrect permissions on a file or folder that 
            contains one of the scripts causes this this error.

            2: Server timeout: If the server was busy, needed to be rebooted, or the connection 
            was lost, the script might still report a 500 Internal Server Error. It’s possible 
            that the error might not happen the next time.
            
*What is 400 ?
    4XX – Client Error
    The 4XX series of error codes is perhaps the most famous due to the iconic 404 Not Found status, 
    which is a well-known marker for URLs and URIs that are incorrectly formed. Other more useful 
    status codes for APIs exist in this range, however.

    414 URI Too Long is a common status code, denoting that the data pushed through in a GET request 
    is too long, and should be converted to a POST request. Another common code is 429 Too many 
    Requests, which is used for rate limiting to note a client is attempting too many requests at once, 
    and that their traffic is being rejected.

*How do you validate your response from your API?



*Are you doing any verifications in your database?
    yes but before that i make sure to create a connection:

      1: Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl,username,password);
    
    Send Queries to the Database Once connection is made, I execute the queries.
    
      2: Statement statement=connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);

    Process Results from the executed query are stored in the ResultSet Object.
    
      3:   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("select * from countries");

        **** Summary of Steps for Selenium Database Testing ****

        Step 1) Make a connection to the Database using method.

            DriverManager.getConnection(URL, "userid", "password" )

        Step 2) Create Query to the Database using the Statement Object.

            Statement stmt = con.createStatement();

        Step 3) Send the query to database using execute query and store the results in the ResultSet object.

            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(select * from employee;);

            


How do you automate database validation part?
    @Test
    public void jdbcMetadata() throws Exception{
	  Connection connection=DriverManager.getConnection(oracleDbUrl, oracleDbUsername, oracleDbPassword); 
	  Statement statement=connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
	  String sql = "select employee_id,last_name,job_id, salary from employees";
	  ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql);
	  
	  // 1: DATABASE METADATA
	  DatabaseMetaData dbMetadata = connection.getMetaData();
	  System.out.println("User:" + dbMetadata.getUserName()); // returns User and database type
	  System.out.println("Database type:" + dbMetadata.getDatabaseProductName());
	  
	  // 2: RESULTSET store it in ResulSetMETADATA
	  ResultSetMetaData rsMedata = resultSet.getMetaData();
	  System.out.println("Columns count:" + rsMedata.getColumnCount());
	  System.out.println( rsMedata.getColumnName(1));
	  
	  //print all column names using a loop
	  for (int i = 1; i <= rsMedata.getColumnCount() ; i++) {
		System.out.println(i +" -> " + rsMedata.getColumnName(i));
	  }
	  
	  //Throw ResulSet into a List of Maps
	  //Create a List of Maps
	  List<Map<String,Object>> list = new ArrayList<>();
	  ResultSetMetaData rsMdata = resultSet.getMetaData();
	  
	  int colCount = rsMdata.getColumnCount(); 
	  
	  while(resultSet.next()) {
		  Map<String,Object> rowMap = new HashMap<>();
		  
		  for(int col = 1; col <= colCount; col++) {
			  rowMap.put(rsMdata.getColumnName(col), resultSet.getObject(col));	  
		  }
		  
		  
		  list.add(rowMap);
	  }
	  
	  //print all Employees ID from a list of maps
	  
	  for (Map<String, Object> emp: list) {
		System.out.println(emp.get("EMPLOYEE_ID"));
	  }

	  resultSet.close();	  
	  statement.close();	  
	  connection.close();
  }
  
  
}

Example: EMP_ID – 9634
