Interview Questions

* JVM:
    - is java virtual machine the jvm actually runs java byte code
    .class files
    - write once and run everywhere -> bytecode

* JRE:
    - is java runtime environment is what you need to run a java program
    and contains a jvm among other things.

* JDK:
    - is java developer kit -- the jdk is what you need to compile 
    java source code. java to .class file
    - to program in java you will need jdk you can install JDK from
    oracle website.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Path and classPath?
    - Path:
         is used to define where the executables are .exe files
         java.exe, javac.exe etc
    - Class path:
         is used to specify location of Java.class files

    - java source code -> compile (javac) -> bytecode .class extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    - Version           Release         end public dates
    - Java SE 7         2011            
    - Java SE 8         2014            january 2019, december 2020

      JAVA 7              vs            JAVA 8 }
    - String in                        - Lambda Expression
    Switch statement                   - pipelines and Streams
    - Multiple Exeception              - date and time API
    Handling                           - Java 8 interface changes
                                        Static Method, Default 
                                        Method
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is garbage collector and how many types?
    - Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap 
    memory identifying which objects are in use and which are not 
    and deleting unused objects
    - An in use object or a referenced object means that some 
    part of your program still maintains a pointer to that 
    object

    * Garbage Collectors
        - serial : works with a single thread works for single
                    threaded apps
        - parallel: uses multiple threads for managing heap space
        - CSM: (current mark sweep) uses multiple GC threads
        - G1: is designed for application running on multiprocessor
        machines with large memory space. breaks heap into smaller regions
    
    * how to call Garbage Collector?
        - System.gc();
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Explain Public Static void main (String args[])
    - public: 
            public is an access modifies which is used to specify who
            can access this method. Public means that this method will be
            accessible by any Class. 
    - static:   
            It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class bases i.e 
            it can be accessed without creating the instance of a class
    - void: 
            it is the return type of the method void defines the method which 
            will not return any value
    - main: 
            it is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a 
            starting point for an application with a particular signature only.
            it is the method where the main executions occurs
    - String args:
            it is the parameter passed to the main method
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* can one class call another class main method?
    - yes a main method can be called in another class main method
    - code will compile without main method but will not run
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what are the primitives and wrapper classes?
    - every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it
    - these are known as wrapper classes because they wrap the primitive data type
    into an object of that class.
    - we can convert from one type to another using casting

    * PRIMITIVE         * WRAPPER CLASS         * CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENT
    boolean             Boolean                  boolean or String
    byte                Byte                     byte or String
    char                Character                char
    int                 Integer                  int or String
    float               Float                    float double or String
    double              Double                   double or String
    long                Long                     long or String
    short               Short                    short or String
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* implicit casting vs explicit casting?
    - Implicit Casting: 
        int i = 100;
        double d = i;

    - Explicit Casting:
        int n = 12;
        byte b = (byte)n;

    - Auto - Boxing
        Integer num = n;

    - Un - Boxing
        int j = num;

DONT WORK:
            Integer i = new Integer(100);
            double d = i ; // will not work

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between Instance Variable and static Variable?
    - Static Variables:
                    belongs to the class itself not to objects 
                    of the class, different objecst can not have different
                    values for a static variable. only one copy of static variable
                    for everyone. Every object instance of a class has its own copy
                    of each instance variable declared in the class

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is constructor in java
* what is the difference between constructor and method?
    - A constructor in java is a block of code similar to a method thats called
    when an instance of an object is created. Difference between constructor and
    method:
        - A constructor doesnt have a return type
        - the name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class
        - unlike methods constructors are not considered members of a class
        - a constructor is called automatically when a new instance of object
        is created
        - the purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object of a class
        while the purpose of a method is to perform a task by executing java code
        - default constructor is added if programmer did not add a constructor. 

                                Types of Java Constructor
                                        |
                                        |
                    ------------------------------------------
                    |                                         |
            default constructor                       parameterized constructor        

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Can a super() and this() keywords be in same constructor?
    - public computer(){
        this();
        super();
        //code
    }
    - NO they both need to be in first line within constructor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Super. VS Super()
    - super. 
            is used to access parent/super class members vars, methods
    - super()
            is used to call super class constructor

* this. VS this()
    - this.
            this object by using this. we can access instance variables and 
            method. to differentiate between instance and argument variable
    - this()
            call a constructor from another constructor in same class

    Example:
        public class computer{
            private String brand;
            
            public computer(){
                this("apple");
            }
            public computer (String brand){
                this.brand = brand;
            }
        }
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is the difference between access modifiers in java?
    Modifier       Class    Package     Subclass    World
    - public         Y          Y           Y          Y
    - protected      Y          Y           Y          N
    - no modifier    Y          Y           N          N
    - private        Y          N           N          N 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is static keyword in java?
    - Static keyword means that the variable or method belongs to class
      and shared between all instances.
    - we can call static members by using class name or object
    - static methods can not call/refer Non Static members
    - Static can be: variables, method, block, inner class

    public class Computer{
        private String brand; 
        public Computer(){ 
             this("Apple"); 
             } 
        public Computer(String brand) { 
            this.brand = brand; } 
            public static class Memory{ 
                private int ramsize; 
            } 
        } 
        Memory c = new Computer().new Memory();
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Static block and instance initializer block?
    - the static initializer block will be called on loading of the class and code
      will run only once in the begining 
    - instance initializer block execute every time you create an object
      for a class. before any constructor. 

    Example:
        public class programer{
            System.out.println("constructor")
        }
        static{
            System.out.println("static")
        }
        {
             System.out.println("instance ")
        }
      
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* pass by value or pass by reference?
    - Java is a “pass-by-value” language. This means that a copy of 
    the variable is made and themethod receives that copy. Assignments 
    made in the method do not affect the caller.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* final vs finally vs finalize()
    - Final:   
            - final is a keyword
            - final is used to apply restriction on class method and variable
            - if a class is marked as final then this class can not be inherited
              by any other class
    - finally: 
            - finally is a block
            - finally is a block which is used for exception handling along with
              try and catch blocks
    - Finalize: 
            - finalize() method is protected method of java.lang.object class
              it is inherited to every class you create in java
            - finalize() methos id used to perform some clean up operations
              on a object before it is removed from memory

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* where did you use static in your framework?
    - I normally write utility classes for better reusability and make 
      all methods in my utilities as static methods so that i can easily 
      call them by class name.
    - dataseUtil class has static methods to connect and run queries and 
      get data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* difference between equals method and "==" operator in java?
    - "==":
            reference and address comparison
            == in case of primitives it is checking the value. as primitives are 
            single value without any behavior. 
    - equals()
            content comparison
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is String pool?
    - String Pool in javais a pool of Strings stored inJava Heap Memory. Used to 
      save space in memory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to reverse String in java?
    1: 
        String string="whatever";
        String reverse = newStringBuilder(string).reverse().toString();
        System.out.println(reverse);
    2:
        String result="";
        for(int i = string.length()-1; i>=0; i--){
            result = result+ string.charAt(i);
        }
        System.out.println(result);

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* how to reverse a sentence word by word?
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    String [] words = string.split(" ");
    for(int j = words.length-1; j>=0; j--){
        stringBuilder.append(words[j].append("");
    }
    System.out.println("reverse Words "+ stringBuilder.toString().trim());

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer?
                STRING          STRINGBUFFER             STRINGBUILDER
Storage         constant        HEAP                    Heap
Area            String pool     

Modifiable      no(inmutable)   YES(mutable)            YES(mutable)
    
Thread Safe     YES             YES                     NO

Performance     FAST            VERY SLOW               FAST

Inmutable means values can not be changed once its created:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* what is Tread-safe or Synchronized?
    - what is tread: A sequential or single threaded program has single flow
    - synchronized: Means that two threads can not execute the method 
      or access the variables at the same time and the JVM takes care of
      enforcing that. it is used to achieve thread-safety
