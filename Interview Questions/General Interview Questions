* technical interview skype
    1.	Write a SQL query to find how many records are there in Town table where 
    “TOWN_NAME” has “ell” in them?
            - select count(*) 
            from town 
            where town_name like '%ell%'; 

    2.	Write a SQL query to find how many occurrences of each “COUNTRY_CODE” are 
    there in the Town table?
            - select country_code,count(*)
            from town 
            Group by country_code;

    3.	Write a SQL query to find the “TOWN_NAME” where there are non-alphanumeric 
    characters?
            select(*)
            from town
            where town_name not like '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';

    4.	Write a SQL query to select the first 5 records from Town table?
            select * 
            from town
            where rownum <= 5;

* selfJoin interview ( )
        1.
        select emp.employee_id, emp.first_name, man.first_name, man.last_name
        from employees emp join employees man
        on emp.manager_id = man.employee_id;

* difference between Intersect and Minus
        - INTERSECT: displays common data en both queries
        - MINUS: returns records from first query that is not present in second query.

 * JOIN VS UNION interview question
        - joins are used to display query from multiple tables
        - Union is used to query data from multiple queries. 

* Display 5th row from table ( CORE RELATED SUB QUERY)

        - we need to use correlated subquery
        - inner query will get columns along with rownumber and outer query will look
        for specific row number
        
        example: 
        - select *
        from (select employee_id,first_name, rownum as rn from employees)
        where rn = 5;
