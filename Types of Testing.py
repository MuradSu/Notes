Types of Testing

3 years ago a project in fannie mae - our regression test runs 14 hours

(hands you a control remote)

1. First I make sure to verify the requirements
2. does it do what its supposed to do 			
	--> functional Testing
	--> positive (testing)
	--> Negative (testing)
3. other tests are to follow non functional tests: easy to use, 
change colors does it turn on with speciffied buttons. are they 
located in the right place then we check for durability.

Functional Testing = basically the testing of the fuctions of component or system is done

Performance Testing = tests performed to determine how fast some aspect of a system 
					  performs under a particular workload

smoke test = pick only main functionalities that are very important like for cybertek online 
			webiste if the appy here is missing then you check. overall smoke test is to check
			only important functionalities
			--> it gets run every day
